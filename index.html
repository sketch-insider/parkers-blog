<p>this website is just gonna be about me. hope you guys are cool with that. <br>
	ok so my name is parker jacobs. i live in nyc rn and its a nice little community, got a nice dealer and what not. the biggest thing about me is that im a 
	<i>HUUUGE</i> stoner. alik kinda hates me for it but i do not care at all. too high to care honestly ;P. anyways, im "friends" with these 2 gay people, joshua
	and benji. josh is a little cool, but his friend is a little (hes not little, bro's tall as shit) freak with no mouth. i've seen armless, but mouthless has
	got to be torture. whatever, im a part of another friend group, the one with alik. evan is here too, he's the goat of this friendgroup lowkey. then there's
	ollie, he used to be josh's boyfriend. i think alik and evan forced him to hang out with us, to like make joshua feel bad or something. i barely pay
	attention at this point. fucking hate school rn, coding class is the only thing keeping me sane. i love coding class so much, im legit coding in my free time,
	oh lord im a nerd.</p>
