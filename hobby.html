<h2>coding</h2>
<p>love me a good coding project. i think coding for the web is the only class ive genuinely gotten an A in. like i said, this is being made in my free time, so
	yeah... anyways im a freelance coder in my freetime, just for that extra cash. its nice to have i guess. anyways i make websites for random things, because
	i have nothing else to do honestly. after school, i just get high and make websites or game. but i just like making websites, i dont publish them because why
	would i?</p>

<div id="gaming">
<h2>gaming</h2>
<p>i play quite a few games, majority of them being shooter games. mainly singleplayer because i do not wanna destroy my mother's tv. i've tried playing puzzle
	games in the past, did <i>not</i> work out whatsoever. i played some with joshua, and he did most of the puzzle solving. back on the topic of shooter games,
	when i do play multiplayer, it genuinely gets so loud. people knock on our front door asking if im alright. which is a little worrying but like, they 
	understand hopefully. im not the best at them, but i try my best, hence why i play singleplayer</p>

<div id="smoking">
<h2>smoking</h2>
<p>i don't smoke cigarettes, reminds me too much of my parents. however, weed on the other hand, love that stuff. honestly, i wish there were more stoners in my 
	school, we could bond or whatever. but i just have to get josh to smoke, i think he enjoys it. idk tho, he doesn't really say anything. anyways, thats the
	reason im failing most of my classes rn. also the fact i do <i>not</i> give a shit about the classes either. also my plug is kinda chill, i just hang out
	him sometimes. he's busy a lot tho, so thats boring.</p>

<div id="cooking">
<h2>cooking</h2>
<p>i started cooking after moving out. i couldnt live off ramen forever, so i decided to learn how to cook. i burnt the fuck out of some spaghetti, and cried
	myself to sleep that night. anyways im working on some new food, i like eating what i made a lot. i understand the hype about home made foods now. it did start
	of a friend tho. i am also now able to make spaghetti, i learned better. i still can't make fucking scrambled eggs, how the fuck do they KEEP BEING ROCK
	HARD WHAT THE FUCK CHICKENS?????</p>
