	hey guys, its been a while, hasn't it? haven't really updated this website in a hot minute. just thought i'd share a little update, or a big one i suppose. i
	like men. im omni, with a preference towards guys. i have a boyfriend, and his name is pot (as far as i know). he's amazing, and he helped me out of my
	social situation. he's also a stoner like i am (he's the final boss of stoners honestly, hes only ever been sober once for the time i've known him). we bumped
	into each other, literally. i accidentally knocked him over, and i helped him up. and we kicked it off from there. so yeah, my website will not be a safe space
	for homophobia. any homophobes reading this, i genuinely hope you get better like i did. have a good day.</p>

<br>
	time itself is such a weird concept, y'know? like time is a man made concept, but it exists in nature. it's the year 2018 but animals dont know that, what do 
	animals know? it's not really like we can ask, right?</p>
</div>
<div class="entries">
<p>entry 12, 1/2/18 <br>
<br>
	why do people even celebrate new years? it just feels so weird to me. we dont celebrate every new month, or decade any more than new years. it's just kinda
	weird that we celebrate time like that at all</p>
</div>
