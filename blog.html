	HAPPY NEW YEARS!!!!! spent the day with that one guy (pot) and had an amazing time, im glad i met him</p>
</div>
	<div class="entries">
<p>entry 40, 12/25/25 <br>
<br>
	christmas time :P <br>
	honestly, this is the only christmas that actually feels magical</p>
</div>
<div class="entries">
<p>hi guys, its pot. just wanted to say hello</p>
</div>
<div class="entries">
<p>entry 39, 7/22/25<br>
<br>
	hey guys, its been a while, hasn't it? haven't really updated this website in a hot minute. just thought i'd share a little update, or a big one i suppose. i
	like men. im omni, with a preference towards guys. i have a boyfriend, and his name is pot (as far as i know). he's amazing, and he helped me out of my
	social situation. he's also a stoner like i am (he's the final boss of stoners honestly, hes only ever been sober once for the time i've known him). we bumped
	into each other, literally. i accidentally knocked him over, and i helped him up. and we kicked it off from there. so yeah, my website will not be a safe space
	for homophobia. any homophobes reading this, i genuinely hope you get better like i did. have a good day.</p>
</div>
	<div class="entries">
<p>entry 38, 12/12/24 <br>
<br>
	hey guys, let's say there's this girl i like. and we've been friends for a long time, how would i admit that i like her?</p>
</div>
<div class="entries">
<p>entry 37, 12/7/24 <br>
<br>
	so we went out to eat, to hang out. i had to feed him because watching him fumble around with a fork is too painful. he's mid bite and the waiter comes up and asks
	how long we've been dating... we both look at eachother in embarrassment. i think we were both blushing hard, i kinda forgot</p>
</div>
<div class="entries">
<p>entry 36, 12/4/24 <br>
<br>
	i was thinking about that winter visit to the park. you normally see that as a scene in a romantic movie. kinda funny to think about</p>
</div>
<div class="entries">
<p>entry 35, 12/2/24 <br>
<br>
	we went back to the park. he started giggling about the time i had to clean ice cream off his face. i genuinely felt my face heat up. i just hope pot doesn't notice, 
	i don't want him to get the wrong impression. the snowfall should be a nice cover</p>
</div>
<div class="entries">
<p>entry 34, 11/16/24 <br>
<br>
	im looking forward to actually making food for pot bro. he seems to enjoy the outcome, and making the food is really fun. i think pot is only coming here for the
	food tho</p>
</div>
<div class="entries">
<p>entry 33, 10/25/24 <br>
<br>
	alik called me screaming at me, i could barely understand him </3. i only understood the word faggot in that whole mess. so now i look gay, fuckin great.</p>
</div>
<div class="entries">
<p>entry 32, 10/24/24 <br>
<br>
	so i was talking with pot and someone knocked on my door. i was in the middle of making him my mac and cheese that i had been hyping up, so he answered the door.
	it was alik, he was confused on why this small twig ass was answering my door instead of me. pot, in all his fucking stupidity answers to alik's question of why
	he's here is "my boyfriend is making me some mac and cheese, so im answering for him." i'm a little preoccupied with the cheese noodles when alik legit screams
	"WHAT THE FUCK!?!?!?" yeah uhm, i think pot ruined my friendship with alik. at least pot enjoyed my mac and cheese</p>
</div>
<div class="entries">
<p>entry 31, 10/2/24 <br>
<br>
	dude, i've been mastering my mac and cheese recipe. this is actually so good</p>
</div>
<div class="entries">
<p>entry 30, 9/26/24 <br>
<br>
	ok so, me and pot have been hanging out more and more recently. we've been just kinda chilling together, one time we went to the park and got ice cream. he got
	ice cream on his face, i had to wipe it off for him. we thought it was funny. i hope he looks that type of happy more</p>
</div>
<div class="entries">
<p>entry 29, 9/15/24 <br>
<br>
	ok so like, he's genuinely really fun to be around. i mean, he actually kinda enjoys my cooking. he says its alright, best thing ever said about it honestly. 
	and like, he's super chill</p>
</div>
<div class="entries">
<p>entry 28, 9/2/24 <br>
<br>
	his name is pot. im being so fr, the weed guy is named pot. i invited him over and we just smoked and like watched tawog. shit was fire honestly</p>
